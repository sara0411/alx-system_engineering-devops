For every additional element, why you are adding it
-Firewalls: This protects each server from unwanted and unauthorized users rather than protecting a single server
-Split components: allows the user to see parts of the page earlier without having to wait for the entire page to be rendered on the server
-Back up Load Balancer: Maintain uninterrupted service just in case the main one fails
